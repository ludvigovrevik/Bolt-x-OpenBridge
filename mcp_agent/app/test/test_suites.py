1. **Summary of the design approach**
   - Creating a user-centered fitness tracking interface that prioritizes daily goals and activity metrics
   - Using a clean, motivational design with high contrast for glanceability 

2. **Key design elements**
   - Progress ring showing daily goal completion
   - Activity card carousel for quick metric viewing
   - Bottom navigation with 4 core sections
   - Personalized greeting with motivational message

3. **Visual description**
   - Color scheme: Primary blue (#3B82F6) with energetic accent colors
   - Typography: Sans-serif for readability, bold headers for emphasis
   - Iconography: Rounded, simple icons with consistent padding
   - Layout: Card-based design with clear visual hierarchy

4. **Interaction patterns**
   - Swipeable cards for different activity metrics
   - Pull-to-refresh for latest sync
   - Tap actions for expanding data cards
   - Long-press for quick actions

1. **Analysis of the problem**
   - Need to find the longest palindrome substring in a given string
   - Naive approach would check all substrings (O(nÂ³) complexity)
   - We'll use Manacher's algorithm for O(n) complexity
   - Edge cases: empty strings, single characters, all unique characters

2. **Solution architecture overview**
   - Preprocess string to handle even-length palindromes
   - Use dynamic programming to expand around centers
   - Track longest palindrome found
   - Return the longest palindrome substring

3. **Code implementation with comments**

```python
def longest_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    '''
    Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string using Manacher's algorithm.
    
    Args:
        s: Input string
        
    Returns:
        Longest palindromic substring
    '''
    if not s or len(s) < 2:
        return s
        
    # Preprocess the string to handle even length palindromes
    # Insert '#' between each character and at boundaries
    processed = '#' + '#'.join(s) + '#'
    n = len(processed)
    
    # p[i] stores the length of palindrome centered at i
    p = [0] * n
    
    # Variables to track center and right boundary of current palindrome
    center = 0
    right = 0
    
    # Variables to track the longest palindrome
    max_len = 0
    max_center = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Mirror of current position
        mirror = 2 * center - i
        
        # If within right boundary, take advantage of mirror property
        if i < right:
            p[i] = min(right - i, p[mirror])
        
        # Expand around center i
        while (i + 1 + p[i] < n and 
               i - 1 - p[i] >= 0 and 
               processed[i + 1 + p[i]] == processed[i - 1 - p[i]]):
            p[i] += 1
        
        # Update center and right boundary if needed
        if i + p[i] > right:
            center = i
            right = i + p[i]
        
        # Update longest palindrome if needed
        if p[i] > max_len:
            max_len = p[i]
            max_center = i
    
    # Calculate start index in original string
    start = (max_center - max_len) // 2
    
    # Return the longest palindrome
    return s[start:start + max_len]
```

4. **Testing considerations**
   - Test with empty strings: should return empty string
   - Test with single character: should return that character
   - Test with all same characters: should return the entire string
   - Test with even-length palindromes: "abba"
   - Test with odd-length palindromes: "racecar"
   - Test with multiple palindromes: pick the longest one
   - Test with very long strings for performance
   - Test with Unicode characters to ensure proper handling
